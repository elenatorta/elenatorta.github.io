I am **Elena Torta**, Associate Professor in Robotics at the
[Department of Mechanical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl).

My research focuses on increasing the level of autonomy of collaborative robotic systems
for applications such as medical robots and infrastructure inspection. I adopt a
system-level approach, with specific research interests in:

- **Control and decision making** for complex robotic systems  
- **Semantic and probabilistic world modelling**  
- **Human–robot interaction and safety**

Before joining TU/e in 2019, I worked at **ASML B.V.**
in various roles.
I obtained my PhD at TU/e with the thesis
> *Approaching Independent Living with Robots* (cum laude). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

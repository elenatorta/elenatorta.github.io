## Research focus

My research aims at **enhancing the autonomy of collaborative robot systems** across
different domains, including:

- **Medical and image-guided robots** (e.g., behavioral autonomy for medical robots)
- **Infrastructure inspection** (e.g., autonomous aerial radiography of wind turbine blades)
- **Agri-food and industrial robotics**
- **Cooperative mobile robots and robotic collectives**

I adopt a **system-level perspective** that connects:

- **Control**  
- **Semantic and probabilistic world models**  
- **Human–robot interaction, intention prediction, and safety** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

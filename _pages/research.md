## Research overview

My research focuses on **collaborative robotics**, i.e. systems with multiple robotic agents that collaborate with each others and or with humans.
Collaboration entails sharing of knowledge, skills or resources among the team members to achive a common goal

Typical questions I work on include:

- How can robots coordinate their motions in dynamic environments such that their actions are   **safe**, yet **efficient**? 
- How can we represent the prior and current knowledge about the environment to enable **effective** and **efficient** decision-making of collaborative robots?
- How do we design robot control software in oder to make interaction with humans smooth, efficient and understandable?

## Current themes

- Geometric collaboration
- Semantic collaboration
- Human-robot collaboration
